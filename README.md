# Project Overview:
The project focuses on detecting financial fraud using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a Kaggle dataset containing transaction data from a financial service company. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques such as correlation plot and count plot were employed to gain insights into the data, revealing that fraud primarily occurs through transfer and cash-out transactions rather than payment, cash-in, and debit transactions. Subsequently, two machine learning models, logistic regression, and random forest, were developed to predict fraudulent transactions.

# Business Problem Addressed:
The project addresses the critical issue of financial fraud, which poses significant risks to financial institutions and customers. By accurately identifying fraudulent transactions, financial service companies can implement proactive measures to prevent fraud, safeguard their assets and maintain customer trust. Utilizing machine learning algorithms for fraud detection enables the automation of this process, allowing for timely detection and prevention of fraudulent activities.
