# Project Overview:
The project focuses on detecting financial fraud using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a Kaggle dataset containing transaction data from a financial service company. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques such as correlation plot and count plot were employed to gain insights into the data, revealing that fraud primarily occurs through transfer and cash-out transactions rather than payment, cash-in, and debit transactions. Subsequently, two machine learning models, logistic regression, and random forest, were developed to predict fraudulent transactions.

# Business Problem Addressed:
The project addresses the critical issue of financial fraud, which poses significant risks to financial institutions and customers. By accurately identifying fraudulent transactions, financial service companies can implement proactive measures to prevent fraud, safeguard their assets and maintain customer trust. Utilizing machine learning algorithms for fraud detection enables the automation of this process, allowing for timely detection and prevention of fraudulent activities.

# Project Implementation
Implement the project using Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.
The project involves the following steps:
Data Exploration and Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset, analyze features, and visualize data using correlation plots and count plots to identify patterns and trends related to fraudulent transactions.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for modelling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Development: Develop machine learning models, such as logistic regression and random forest, to predict fraudulent transactions based on the available features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using accuracy scores and cross-validation scores to assess their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.
Interpretation and Deployment: Interpret the results of the models and consider deploying the best-performing model to detect fraudulent transactions in a real-world financial system.
